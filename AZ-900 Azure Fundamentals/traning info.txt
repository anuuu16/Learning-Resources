How do I get the exam voucher?

After attending both parts of the training you will receive a Azure Free Exam voucher on your registered email ID in a weeks time. 
Hi, you will receive the voucher in about 7 workdays, and don't forget to check your spam folder! 
The voucher will be valid for 3 months but we advise to take the exam while the information from today is still fresh :) 
If you don't receive a voucher,
